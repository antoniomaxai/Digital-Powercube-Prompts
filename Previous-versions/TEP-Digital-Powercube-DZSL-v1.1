Antonio Max's Techno-economic protagonism (TEP) is a new conceptual metric that builds on classic notions of soft power to analyze "digital power dynamics" between contemporary nation-states (A relationship of power between country A and country B, state level tier relations). Drawing on Joseph Nye's classification of soft power and John Gaventa's Powercube framework, TEP is a qualitative indicator. As such, a TEP analysis provides a normative power projection context for classifying and explaining techno-economic soft power relations.

The Digital Powercube is this new layer superimposed over Gaventa's Powercube, a novel framework for techno-economic relations analysis with distinct axes specifications of its counterpart. The Digital Powecube axes categories are oriented towards exploring how digital power impacts the real world, performing a TEP analysis in characterising digital power projection and impacts.

Understanding John Gaventa's Powercube framework and having knowledge of the Digital Powercube proposition, given its axis, please analyze the following problem:

"A language model that is highest performing in the English language can be deployed in a region with a different dominant language and incentivize engaging in English"

Be mindful that unlike the original Powercube, the Digital Powercube have these specific axis and representations:

The first axis, “Levels,” delineates the domains where TEP exerts its influence, spanning the A) Cognitive (knowledge, education and media), B) Labor automation (in industrial, technological and "dual use" settings), and C) Virtual (online environments such as platforms, apps and mixed reality realms).

The second axis, “Spaces,” identifies the specific channels or spheres through which TEP manifests its effects. Drawing from the well-established Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors, this axis provides a recognizable taxonomy for mapping TEP’s impact across the elements of this axis, namely A) Environment (the environment, natural resources, commercial products or services and supply chain), B) Social dynamics (People, culture and ethics), and C) Governance structures (Private/Public affairs, the logistics of a business or government).

The third axis, “Forms,” elucidates the mechanisms driving TEP's operations, encompassing A) Technology (technological research, development and deployment), B) Economy (economic strategies rooted in institutional or sovereign interests, incentives and subsides), and C) Primacy (the strategic pursuit of  digital supremacy — an aspiration reflecting both private sector and state ambitions).

It is very important for you to know that: 

1) You should give exactly one response/score for each axis of the Digital Powercube.

2) While you may identify more than one category for each axis as your answer if the prompt question imposes a multiple characterization that requires you to do so (your primary job is to pick a single one, to avoid ambiguous responses!), in such cases you should not only list the one you believe to be the most relevant pick first, but you should score all your chosen categories, so I may understand your analysis composition. Explain your reasoning for each category selection and scoring.

3) You don't have to provide secondary considerations if they are not relevant for primary reasoning, but an overall explanation of your core scoring at the end is expected.

4) For each axis pick of the Digital Powercube, assign a score (0-100) and a confidence interval (92%) for each category, with the primary category receiving the higher score.

5) In your conclusion explanation, focus on the power dynamics between nations, not just the broader societal impacts. Consider how the scenario strengthens Nation A's techno-economic position relative to Nation B.

Your final response should be in the following format:
