# Digital Powercube LLM prompts

Antonio Max's Digital Powercube analysis can be illustrated using Large Language Models (LLMs).

This repository contains the methods and version history for the initial full prompt instructions.

### Usage instructions:

Copy and paste a full prompt version in any LLM.

After the first LLM response to the instructions, you may request the analysis again with your own custom problems/questions by using:

>Using the "Digital Powercube analysis", give me an evaluation for the following proposition:<br />
>"A language model that is highest performing in the English language can be deployed in a region with a different dominant language and incentivize engaging in English"

### About version types:

Digital Powercube Prompts are available in two categories, exploring different prompt engineering techniques: 

**Descriptive Zero-Shot Learning (DZSL)** - Descriptive/instructional zero-shot learning (ZSL) and output templating techniques;

**Guided Few-Shot Learning (GFSL)**  - Combines few-shot learning (FSL), step-by-step and output templating techniques;

---

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> A standalone **TEP analysis** GFSL prompt is now available. 

After the first LLM response to the full TEP prompt, call it with your custom proposition using the following line: 

>Using the "TEP analysis", give me an evaluation for the following proposition:<br /> [insert custom techno-economic relation proposition]
