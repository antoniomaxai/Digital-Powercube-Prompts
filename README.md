# Digital Powercube LLM prompts

Antonio Max's Digital Powercube analysis can be illustrated using Large Language Models (LLMs).

This repository contains the methods and version history for the initial full prompt instructions.

## Usage instructions:

Click on a prompt file version, click on the "Raw" button, copy and paste the full prompt in any LLM.

After the first LLM response to the instructions, you may request the analysis again with your own custom problems/questions by using:

>Using the "Digital Powercube analysis", give me an evaluation for the following proposition:<br />
>"A language model that is highest performing in the English language can be deployed in a region with a different dominant language and incentivize engaging in English"

## About version types:

Digital Powercube Prompts are available in two categories, exploring different prompt engineering techniques: 

**Descriptive Zero-Shot Learning (DZSL)** - Descriptive/instructional zero-shot learning (ZSL) and output templating techniques;

**Guided Few-Shot Learning (GFSL)**  - Combines few-shot learning (FSL), step-by-step and output templating techniques;

---

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> A standalone **TEP analysis** GFSL prompt is now available. 

After the first LLM response to the full TEP prompt, call it with your custom proposition using the following line: 

>Using the "TEP analysis", give me an evaluation for the following proposition:<br /> [insert custom techno-economic relation proposition]

## Sample prompt results

What can you expect from these prompts?

The following digital sovereignty anecdote was used to sample both TEP and Digital Powercube LLM analytics:

>**A leading AI nation has developed an AI system for monitoring and predicting the spread of infectious and rare diseases based on large-scale data sets from its own public health agencies, hospitals and research institutions. While this has enabled the nation to hone its data standards expertise and EHR record domestic policy standardization, it also presents real obstacles for the commercialization of this platform with other nations, such as medical data governance, public health surveillance, and strategic personalized medicine. Other nations are advised to develop their own datasets as data-sharing agreements and system inference may differ greatly between demographics, but this hinders broad platform adoption across the world for at least two years, time that the platform creator nation will spend using to fine tune and optimize their services and workforce expertise.**

| Standalone-TEP-GFSL-v1.0 	| Gemini 	| ## Qualitative TEP Analysis: Limited Adoption of AI Disease Prediction Platform<br><br>1. Actors:<br>   - Provider actor: Leading AI Nation (Nation A)<br>   - Dependent actor: Other Nations (Nation B)<br><br>2. TEP Level Assessment:<br>   - Provider actor (Higher TEP): Nation A possesses a high TEP level due to its development of the AI system, demonstrating strong domestic capabilities in data collection, analysis, and AI development. This indicates a high degree of digital sovereignty in public health data and disease prediction technology.<br>   - Dependent actor (Lower TEP): Other nations (Nation B) have a lower TEP level due to their reliance on Nation A's platform. Their dependence creates a vulnerability in public health preparedness and disease monitoring.  <br><br>3. Techno-economic Dependency Analysis:<br>   - Asymmetry in Digital Assets: Nation A controls the core digital asset â€“ the AI platform and its underlying data. Nation B lacks its own platform and may not have the expertise to develop one quickly. <br>   - Potential Negative Impacts:<br>     - Nation B faces delays in disease prediction capabilities, hindering its ability to respond to outbreaks effectively.<br>     - Dependence creates a lock-in effect, limiting Nation B's ability to innovate or pursue alternative solutions.<br>     - Reliance on Nation A's data governance and public health surveillance strategies may not be optimal for Nation B's specific demographics or needs.<br>   - Recommendations:<br>     - Nation B should invest in building its own public health data infrastructure and AI expertise.<br>     - Explore data-sharing partnerships with other nations facing similar challenges.<br>     - Prioritize developing domestic AI capabilities for disease prediction, even if it takes longer than adopting Nation A's platform.<br><br>4. Evaluation of Provider's Position:<br>   - Nation A's limited platform adoption creates a temporary advantage. It allows them to refine their system and build expertise, potentially solidifying their position in the future.<br>   - However, Nation A's long-term goal of platform adoption weakens its leverage if other nations become self-sufficient.<br><br>Conclusion:<br>This TEP analysis highlights the importance of prioritizing long-term digital sovereignty in public health. While Nation A gains a temporary advantage with its platform, Nation B's dependence creates vulnerabilities and hinders its own technological development. By investing in domestic data infrastructure and AI expertise, Nation B can mitigate these risks and achieve long-term digital sovereignty in disease prediction and public health preparedness. 	|
|  	| Mistral AI 	| Qualitative TEP Analysis: AI-powered infectious disease monitoring platform and its global adoption challenges<br><br>1. Actors:<br>   - Provider actor: Leading AI nation (Nation A)<br>   - Dependent actor: Other nations seeking to adopt the AI platform (Nation B)<br><br>2. TEP Level Assessment:<br>   - Provider actor (Higher TEP): Nation A has developed an advanced AI system for monitoring and predicting infectious diseases, leveraging large-scale data sets from its public health agencies, hospitals, and research institutions. This expertise in data standards, EHR record standardization, and AI-driven health services positions Nation A as a digital power with high TEP.<br>   - Dependent actor (Lower TEP): Nation B lacks the comprehensive datasets and AI capabilities required to develop a similar platform independently. As a result, Nation B is forced to rely on Nation A's technology, diminishing its digital sovereignty and TEP.<br><br>3. Techno-economic Dependency Analysis:<br>   - Asymmetry in Digital Assets: Nation A's ownership and control of the AI platform and extensive datasets create a significant asymmetry in digital assets between the provider and dependent actors. This dependency forces Nation B to accept Nation A's terms, potentially leading to digital colonialism, digital extractivism, and limited room for innovation.<br>   - Potential Negative Impacts: Nation B's reliance on Nation A's AI platform may hinder its domestic talent development in AI and health informatics, as well as its ability to establish its own data governance and public health surveillance policies. The two-year adoption delay further exacerbates these challenges, as Nation A continues to refine and optimize its services and workforce expertise.<br>   - Recommendations: Nation B should prioritize long-term digital sovereignty by investing in talent retention, domestic R&D in AI and health informatics, and indigenous technological capabilities. Collaborating with like-minded peers through PPPs and alliances can also help mitigate the risks associated with techno-economic dependency.<br><br>4. Evaluation of Provider's Position:<br>   The scenario reinforces Nation A's techno-economic primacy, as its AI platform and extensive datasets position it as a leading digital power. The two-year adoption delay for Nation B further solidifies Nation A's position, as it allows for additional advancements and workforce expertise development. This dynamic may potentially undermine Nation B's medium-term technological capabilities and response.<br><br>Conclusion:<br>The TEP analysis of the AI-powered infectious disease monitoring platform highlights the challenges and risks associated with techno-economic dependency. To mitigate these risks and achieve genuine digital autonomy, nations must prioritize long-term digital sovereignty through investments in talent, R&D, and indigenous technologies, as well as strategic alliances with like-minded peers. 	|
