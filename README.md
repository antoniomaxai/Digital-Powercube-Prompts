# Digital Powercube LLM prompts

Antonio Max's Digital Powercube analysis can be illustraded via Large Language Models (LLM's).

This repository stores methods and version history for initial full prompt instructions.

### Usage instructions:

Copy and paste a full prompt version in any LLM.

After the first LLM response to the instructions, you may request the analysis again with your own custom problems/questions by using:

`Using the "Digital Powercube analysis", give me an evaluation for the following proposition:
`
`"A language model that is highest performing in the English language can be deployed in a region with a different dominant language and incentivize engaging in English"
`

### About versions:

Prompts are available in two categories, exploring different prompt engineering techniques: 

**Descriptive Zero-Shot Learning (DZSL)** - Descriptive/instructional zero-shot learning (ZSL) and output templating techniques;

**Guided Few-Shot Learning (GFSL)**  - Combines few-shot learning (FSL), step-by-step and output templating techniques;
