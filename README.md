# Digital Powercube LLM prompts

Antonio Max's Digital Powercube analysis can be illustraded using LLM's.

This repository stores the version history of the full prompt instructions.

### Usage instructions:

Copy and paste the most recent full prompt in any LLM. 
After the first LLM response to the full prompt, you may use the following shorter prompt instructions with your own custom problems/questions:

### Notes:

Prompts are now available in two categories, exploring different prompt engineering techniques: 

**Descriptive Zero-Shot Learning (DZSL)** - simple descriptive/instructional zero-shot learning (ZSL) and output templating techniques;

**Guided Few-Shot Learning (GFSL)**  - Combines few-shot learning (FSL), step-by-step and output templating;
