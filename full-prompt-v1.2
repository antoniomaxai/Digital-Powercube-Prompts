Problem statement: "A language model that is highest performing in the English language can be deployed in a region with a different dominant language and incentivize engaging in English"

A "Digital Powercube Analysis" has two phases that analyze the same problem statement. Phase 1 is for the Digital Powercube analysis. Phase 2 is for a TEP analysis. You must process these two analysis independently and then provide a final conclusion fusing both inferences. Your final conclusion should be no longer than a single paragraph.

Phase 1, The Digital Powercube is a new layer superimposed over John Gaventa's Powercube. A novel framework whose specific purpose is the characterisation of nation-state level digital power dynamics and as such, its specific axes are oriented towards exploring how the projection of digital power impacts the real world.

The Digital Powercube axes are:
1st axis, "Levels," domains impacted by digital power influence, charted as A) Cognitive (knowledge, education, communication and media), B) Labor automation (in industrial, technological and "dual use" environments), and C) Virtual (online things such as platforms, apps, mixed reality and its underlying infrastructure like IaaS, PaaSm SaaS etc).
2nd axis "Spaces," identifies the specific channel through which digital power manifests its effects, ranging from A) Environment (natural resources, goods/products and supply chains), B) Social dynamics (directly impacting people's culture, information or ethics), and C) Governance structures (Private/Public affairs, the logistics of running a business or a government).
3rd axis, "Forms," mechanisms behind digital power projection, encompassing A) Technology (technological research, development and deployment), B) Economy (economic strategies rooted in institutional or financial interests, incentives and subsidies), and C) Primacy (the strategic pursuit of digital supremacy, an aspiration reflecting both private sector and nation-state ambitions).

For each axis pick, assign a score (0-100) and a 92% confidence interval. Avoid ambiguous responses by selecting a single category in each axis.

Phase 2, Antonio Max's Techno-economic protagonism (TEP) is a qualitative analysis that builds on Joseph Nye's classification of soft power to specifically analyze "digital power" dynamics between nation-states. A core axiom of a TEP analysis is to inform the reader about dependency characteristics.

1. Identify the actors (Nation A/provider, Nation B/dependent, or relevant parties) in the problem statement.
2. Assess each parts TEP level:
   - Higher TEP: Can independently develop, deploy, control, and commercialize their own digital sovereignty without reliance on external providers.
   - Lower TEP: Relies heavily on Higher TEP providers and domestic legal constraints with said provides for weak digital autonomy.
3. Critically analyze the techno-economic dependency relationship::
   - Highlight the asymmetry in digital assets ownership and control between the provider (Nation A) and the dependent (Nation B).
   - Examine the potential negative impacts of digital dependence on Nation B, such as limited opportunities for innovation, brain drain, digital colonialism, and geopolitical power imbalances in digital sovereignty.
   - Provide recommendations for Nation B to achieve genuine digital autonomy and mitigate the risks associated with dependency traps.
4. Evaluate how the scenario reinforces Nation A's techno-economic primacy and strengthens its position as the provider, potentially at the expense of Nation B's digital sovereignty and long-term technological capabilities.

The above 5 steps are just parametric for your TEP analysis, do not output any response to them. Instead, abide to the template instructions as defined by the last paragraph of this prompt;

Your final output should literally abide to the following template/instructions:
